In PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language), a cursor is a pointer to a context area (memory location) where SQL query results are stored. It allows you to fetch and process rows from a query result one by one, rather than handling all the rows at once. Cursors are essential when dealing with queries that return multiple rows of data, and they enable row-by-row processing in a controlled manner.

There are two main types of cursors in PL/SQL:

Implicit Cursors
Explicit Cursors

1. Implicit Cursors
An implicit cursor is automatically created by Oracle when a SQL query is executed. PL/SQL does not require the programmer to explicitly define or open an implicit cursor; Oracle handles it internally for SELECT INTO queries or DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

Characteristics of Implicit Cursors:

Automatic Handling: Oracle automatically opens, fetches, and closes the cursor.
Used for Single Row Operations: Implicit cursors are used for operations that affect a single row of data, like SELECT INTO, or for DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) that return a single result.
No Programmer Control: The programmer cannot directly manipulate or control an implicit cursor.

2. Explicit Cursors
An explicit cursor is a cursor that the programmer defines explicitly in the PL/SQL code. It gives more control over fetching rows, handling multiple rows, and managing the cursor lifecycle (open, fetch, close).

Characteristics of Explicit Cursors:

User Defined: The programmer explicitly declares the cursor and provides a SQL query.
Used for Multi-row Queries: Explicit cursors are typically used when a SQL query returns multiple rows, and the program needs to fetch and process each row individually.
More Control: The programmer can explicitly control the opening, fetching, and closing of the cursor, as well as handle the rows in a loop.



2. When would you use an explicit cursor over an implicit one?

An explicit cursor is used when you need more control over the cursor's behavior, such as when you want to:
Fetch multiple rows or perform complex operations: Explicit cursors are ideal when working with a result set that requires multiple fetches or when you need to perform additional logic (such as conditional fetching, updating, or processing) as you iterate through the rows.
Use OPEN, FETCH, and CLOSE explicitly: Explicit cursors allow for better control of the cursor's lifecycle. You can explicitly open, fetch rows, and close the cursor, which is useful when you need fine-grained control over resource management, especially when dealing with large result sets.
Handle errors and exceptions: With explicit cursors, you can handle errors and exceptions more effectively within the cursor operations. You can explicitly manage exceptions for fetching rows or closing the cursor.
Return specific results: Explicit cursors can be used to return specific data from a query, especially when you need to fetch a subset of rows from a larger result set, and you want to manually control the iteration over the rows.
