1. What is the use of the ALTER command in SQL?

In SQL, the "ALTER" command is used to modify the structure of an existing table within a database, 
allowing you to add, delete, or change columns, as well as add or modify constraints like primary keys and foreign keys,
 essentially making structural changes to the table without creating a new one. 

Syntax: The most common usage is "ALTER TABLE [table_name] [modification operation]". 

2. How can you add, modify, and drop columns from a table using ALTER?

The ALTER TABLE statement in SQL is used to add, remove, or modify columns in an existing table. 
The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and remove various constraints on existing tables.

Add a column
Use the ALTER TABLE statement with the ADD COLUMN clause. 
For example, ALTER TABLE SALES ADD COLUMN SOLD_QTY SMALLINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0. 

Drop a column
Use the ALTER TABLE statement with the DROP COLUMN clause. 
For example, ALTER TABLE SALES DROP COLUMN SOLD_QTY. 

Modify a column
Use the COLLATE clause to specify a new collation for the altered column. 
For example, COLLATE < collation_name >.
