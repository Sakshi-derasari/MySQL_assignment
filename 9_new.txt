1. What is the purpose of GRANT and REVOKE in SQL?

In SQL, the GRANT and REVOKE commands are used to manage permissions (or privileges) for users or roles on database objects such as tables, 
views, or procedures. These commands help control access to data and operations in the database.

1. GRANT
The GRANT command is used to give specific permissions to users or roles. It allows a user or role to perform actions on a database object. These permissions can include the ability to SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or other database actions, depending on the database system.

Syntax:

GRANT privilege_type ON object TO user;
privilege_type: The type of permission (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.).
object: The database object you are granting access to (e.g., a table or view).
user: The user or role receiving the privilege.
Example:

GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO john;
This gives the user john the ability to SELECT (read) and INSERT (write) data on the employees table.

You can also grant all privileges on a table:


GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON employees TO john;

2. REVOKE
The REVOKE command is used to remove or withdraw previously granted privileges. It effectively reverses the effects of the GRANT command.

Syntax:

REVOKE privilege_type ON object FROM user;
privilege_type: The type of permission you want to revoke.
object: The database object (table, view, etc.) from which the permission is being revoked.
user: The user or role whose privilege you are removing.
Example:

REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM john;
This removes the SELECT permission on the employees table from the user john, meaning they can no longer read data from that table.

You can also revoke all privileges:
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON employees FROM john;



2. How do you manage privileges using these commands?

To manage privileges in SQL using the GRANT and REVOKE commands, you need to:

1. Grant Privileges (Using GRANT)
You use the GRANT command to assign specific permissions to users or roles. Privileges define what a user can do with a database object, like reading data, modifying it, or performing administrative tasks.

Example: Granting Specific Privileges
Grant SELECT and INSERT on a table:

GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO john;
Grant ALL privileges on a table (providing full access):

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON employees TO john;
Grant with the WITH GRANT OPTION: Allows the user to pass on their privileges to other users.
privileges.

2. Revoke Privileges (Using REVOKE)
The REVOKE command removes privileges previously granted to users or roles. This is useful when you need to restrict or change access.

Example: Revoking Specific Privileges
Revoke SELECT privilege from a user:


REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM john;
Revoke ALL privileges from a user:


REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON employees FROM john;
Revoke Privileges from Roles
If a role is assigned privileges and a user has that role, you can revoke the privileges from the role:

3. Viewing Privileges
To check what privileges a user or role has, you can query the database's system tables (this varies by DBMS). For example:

In MySQL, you can use:

SHOW GRANTS FOR 'john';
